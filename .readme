Project Overview

This project will aim to predict an individual's Big 5 personality traits—Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism—along with nuanced psychological metrics like Sense of Coherence, Balance, Comprehensibility, Manageability, Meaningfulness, and Reflection. These predictions will be based on the analysis of text from social media posts. The methodology will integrate state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques, combining semantic vector representations and emotional lexicons. By transforming the text into numerical representations through pre-trained GloVe word embeddings and incorporating emotional lexicons such as LIWC, AFINN, and NRC Emotion Lexicon, we will create a multi-faceted feature model.
Methodology

The project will leverage machine learning algorithms trained on an extensive dataset of labeled social media posts to predict both the Big 5 traits and additional psychological metrics. The text data will undergo preprocessing steps like tokenization, vectorization, and feature extraction. These feature vectors, consisting of word embeddings and emotion lexicon values, will serve as the inputs to machine learning models. Algorithms such as Random Forest, SVM, and Neural Networks will be employed for prediction, with performance evaluation based on a range of metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Implications and Future Work

By successfully predicting a wide range of psychological and emotional metrics, this project will lay the groundwork for the development of sophisticated digital representations of individual human minds. In a transhumanist future, such digital models could serve as interfaces between humans and advanced computational systems, including potential Artificial General Intelligences. The multidimensional personality and psychological model could become an integral component of future systems designed to extend human cognition and emotional understanding. As we look towards a future where the line between human and machine continues to blur, the nuanced understanding of individual human psychology this project aims to achieve could be pivotal in ethical and symbiotic human-machine co-evolution.
